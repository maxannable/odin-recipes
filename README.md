# odin-recipes
This is a project from the Odin Project curriculum. I am putting into practice how to create a new repository on GitHub, move a repository onto my local machine, and build the basics of a simple html website. 
Inside of a basis html website I practiced bulding multiple pages, setting up the html boilerplate in each page, and working with links and different types of lists.
